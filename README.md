# 🧠 Mini RAG Chatbot (Free GenAI Project)

A fully functional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built using HuggingFace embeddings, ChromaDB vector database, and Groq LLM (Llama 3.1).

This project demonstrates how modern GenAI systems retrieve context from documents before generating responses — reducing hallucinations and improving factual accuracy.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This system allows users to:

- Upload a PDF document
- Split it into semantic chunks
- Convert chunks into embeddings
- Store embeddings in a vector database (Chroma)
- Retrieve relevant context using similarity search
- Generate grounded answers using Groq LLM

The AI answers questions strictly based on the uploaded document.
